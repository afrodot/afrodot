At 100 feet (30 meters) or more above ground, they can take advantage of the faster and less turbulent wind. Turbines catch the wind&#8217;s energy with their propeller-like blades. Usually, two or three blades are mounted on a shaft to form a\u00a0<em>rotor<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>A blade acts much like an airplane wing. When the wind blows, a pocket of low-pressure air forms on the downwind side of the blade. The low-pressure air pocket then pulls the blade toward it, causing the rotor to turn. This is called\u00a0<em>lift<\/em>. The force of the lift is actually much stronger than the wind&#8217;s force against the front side of the blade, which is called\u00a0<em>drag<\/em>. The combination of lift and drag causes the rotor to spin like a propeller, and the turning shaft spins a generator to make electricity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wind is caused when the earth&#8217;s surface is heated unevenly by the sun.
