Even a clock could drain enough power over time to mean you hear the dreaded click when you try to start the engine.<\/p>\n<p>In an ideal world we\u2019d all keep our cars topped up using a mains-powered\u00a0battery charger, but in reality not all of us have access to a plug.<\/p>\n<p>The solution could be to use the sun to keep your battery in tip-top condition with a solar-powered charger. Place one in the windscreen and it could ensure you always have enough juice to keep your gadgets running and still churn the starter motor when you turn the key.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Before you buy a solar charger, work out what is the\u00a0 best for your situation and vehicle.
